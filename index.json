In addition to Computer Science, I have a strong interest in Mathematics. As a part of my B.Tech, I have worked on a wide range of projects ranging from Web Development to Deep Learning. My Bachelor Thesis was on, \u0026quot;Why Deep Learning Works?\u0026ldquo; with Dr. Samar Agnihotri. This brought in a partial understanding to my ever-existing question on what makes Deep Learning so powerful. Also, Cyber Security is a field that I would love to explore further.\nI think of myself as a hard-working and fun-loving person, who makes sure to stick to the timelines. I like travelling to new places. In my free time, I can be found enjoying nature, learning to bake, reading or making travel plans :D. I have always been fascinated by the advancements shaping our future and believe that the only attitude that keeps one going is to never stop learning.

I was in Germany then (semester-exchange) and didn’t bother to give much attention to it, since I was too busy with my course work and in planning trips to beautiful places across Europe, oblivious of the fact that the world is soon going to be under lockdown.\n  I, at Zürich during my trip to Switzerland in January 2020.   Luckily, I completed my semester exams by mid-February 2020 and was to come back to India, when I again heard of the virus, this time, it was called Covid-19 and was a much more serious affair than I had expected in January. The gravity of the matter could be realized from my surroundings, the fear among the people, the mails from the University asking to maintain social distancing and staying alert of any symptoms, and my parents showing concern about me going to the crowded airports. Amidst all this tiny chaos, I had still assumed that the virus won’t be able to cross the China borders. Airports seemed as usual with some people wearing masks, and some others staring at their strange new look. I was so excited to go back home that there was no room for worry in my mind. From Germany to India with co-passengers from all over the world, I was busy enjoying my window seat, recapitulating all the memories of Europe. The news of the virus was spreading like fire. Everywhere I went, it was the only topic being discussed, and this process, in some sense, really made me think. Every day, the number of cases in India (and the world) was increasing exponentially, and within a few weeks that I had joined my college in India, we were sent home because of the govt. guidelines keeping in mind the risks of the virus spreading amongst the students. The semester was cut in-between, with no planned alternatives to continue the teaching. Schools and universities were closed in almost all parts of the world for an indefinite time period…\n  WHO declared Covid-19 coronavirus infection a pandemic. Credit: Tumisu from Pixabay.   The world was hit by a pandemic! Something, that it had never seen before. Humans were caged in their homes, encountering huge loss, some in terms of money, some in terms of health, and the government trying hard to come up with all kinds of safety measures. The fast and furious pace of life was brought to a halt by a microscopic being. Technology indeed played a crucial role in these times. MNCs, govt. offices and educational institutes soon adapted to the virtual mode of communication and events (from schooling to weddings) that only used to happen in an in-person mode, were now being held online. Sanitizers and masks became an everyday utility and strict measures were imposed on any kind of gatherings. The world also experienced a time when all the transportation was stopped, local trains as well as international flights. With technology coming to the rescue in such times, there’s more to ponder upon. The pandemic brought many people home, giving them time to think about the delightful gift of life, that of family and friends, and the need to celebrate their existence every day. This new mode of life has definitely made us stronger and loving, as some people rightly address it as, “nature’s way of reminding humans of humanity!”\n","date":1617580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617667200,"objectID":"1438068c9dd3a6e489f851f46bfbd33a","permalink":"https://manvi07.github.io/post/world-pandemic/","publishdate":"2021-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/world-pandemic/","section":"post","summary":"The fast and furious pace of life brought to a halt by a microscopic being.","tags":["lockdown"],"title":"The World was Hit by a Pandemic!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"da1e1dfedf4b8c9bc96f247ce47a4d38","permalink":"https://manvi07.github.io/project/algodiff/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/algodiff/","section":"project","summary":"A distributed computation of the derivative of large computer programs in tangent mode.","tags":null,"title":"AlgoDiff Spark","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"80eebfd1be6abcc41d79ce566891d133","permalink":"https://manvi07.github.io/project/sat/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sat/","section":"project","summary":"A basic implementation of the DPLL algorithm with unit propagation and backtracking.","tags":null,"title":"SAT Solver","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manvi Gupta"],"categories":["solution proposal"],"content":"","date":1590278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590278400,"objectID":"7a0cca617d558b17f93ddad0dfe85d67","permalink":"https://manvi07.github.io/post/hacking-google-maps/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hacking-google-maps/","section":"post","summary":"Organised by Heuristics club at IIT Mandi.","tags":["heuristics contest"],"title":"Hacking-Google-Maps Contest Submission","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.

Python is a free, easy to use a high-level programming language which has seen a huge expansion in the number of its users and developers in recent years. Specifically, a lot of recent studies show that the use of Python in Astrophysics and general physics has increased exponentially. We aim to provide a very high level of abstraction, an easy to use interface and pleasing user experience. EinsteinPy is developed keeping in mind the state of a theoretical gravitational physicist with little or no background in computer programming and trying to work in the field of numerical relativity or trying to use simulations in their research. Currently, EinsteinPy supports simulation of time-like and null geodesics and calculates trajectories in different background geometries some of which are Schwarzschild, Kerr, and KerrNewmann along with coordinate inter-conversion pipeline. It has a partially developed pipeline for plotting and visualization with dependencies on libraries like Plotly, matplotlib, etc. One of the unique features of EinsteinPy is a sufficiently developed symbolic tensor manipulation utilities which are a great tool in itself for teaching yourself tensor algebra which for many beginner students can be overwhelmingly tricky. EinsteinPy also provides few utility functions for hypersurface embedding of Schwarzschild spacetime which further will be extended to model gravitational lensing simulation.","tags":null,"title":"EinsteinPy: A Community Python Package for General Relativity","type":"publication"}]
